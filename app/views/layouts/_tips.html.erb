  	<h2>Tips!</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Try to give your item a descriptive title.  That is how people will find it</li>  
    <li>Accurately describe the condition of your item to insure that whoever gets your item gets what they expect</li>
    <li>The value you set is visible only by you.  We use it to make sure you don't accidentally trade a TV for a lamp (unless you value the lamp more).</li>
